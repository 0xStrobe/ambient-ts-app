- [ ] Does the code stick to our formatting and code standards? Does running prettier and ESLint over the code should yield no warnings or errors respectively?
- [ ] Does the change re-implement code that would be better served by pulling in a well known module from the ecosystem?
- [ ] Does TypeScript code compile without raising linting errors?
- [ ] Instead of using raw strings, are constants used in the main class? Or if these strings are used across files/classes, is there a static class for the constants?
- [ ] Are magic numbers explained? There should be no number in the code without at least a comment of why it is there. If the number is repetitive, is there a constant/enum or equivalent?
- [ ] Is there a proper /* */ for block comments in the various classes and methods?
- [ ] Are unit tests used where possible? In most cases, tests should be present for APIs, interfaces with data access, transformation, backend elements and models. Ponicode can help with test generation. Ponicode creates test files using Jest syntax.
- [ ] Are tests arranged correctly with the Arrange/Act/Assert pattern and properly documented in this way?
- [ ] If there is an asynchronous method, does the name of the method end with the Async suffix?
- [ ] Is a minimum level of logging in place? Is the logging level is the right one?
- [ ] Is document fragment manipulation limited to when you need to manipulate multiple sub elements?
- [ ] Are heavy operations implemented in the backend, leaving the controller as thin as possible?
- [ ] Is event handling on the html efficiently done?
